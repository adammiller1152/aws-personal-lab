# aws-personal-lab
Repo showcasing my current AWS skillsets

## About this project
This project was made to showcase my current skills within AWS by building a personal lab environment that will be used for self-study as well as professional growth. As I learn about a new AWS service or technology that is interesting to me, I'll attempt to incorporate it within this project as time permits.
